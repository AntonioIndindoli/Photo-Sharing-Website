# Photo Sharing Website
This website was briefly hosted using Heroku web services with a purchased domain. It was mainly created as a learning exercise and hosting it allowed me to test the functionality by inviting my friends to use it. The site allowed for account creation, uploading and viewing pictures with descriptions, and commenting on those pictures.
